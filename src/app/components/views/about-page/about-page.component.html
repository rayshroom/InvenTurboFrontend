<h1>What is InvenTurbo?</h1>
<p>Most small and medium-sized businesses, especially ones in the food industry, are currently using a local computerized system in their inventory and transaction management. This method may be working but inefficient due to the lack of data communication between parties. One drawback of it would be latency and possible inaccuracy in identifying the availability of supply (e.g.: A local bar calls-in for the supply of beer. They have to wait for the distributor to check if they have sufficient stock to fulfil the order. If not, the bar has to call another distributor. In some cases, the distributor might accept the order and then decline it after realizing there is not enough stock.). Another issue would be an order being lost or misplaced during the process due to human errors. Moreover, the current practice produces challenges for record-keeping, tracking parameters in real-time and querying information for business analytics.</p>
