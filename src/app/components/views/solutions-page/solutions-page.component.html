<h1>How does our solution work?</h1>
<p>The solution we will be providing is a centralized platform for communication and transaction management between distributors and retailers. Both distributors and retailers can track transaction and inventory through a mobile app. Upon delivery, the retailers can use the app to read QR codes from the courier to add received goods to their inventory. Since most retailers require periodical supply, the distributor will be notified when stock is insufficient for future orders. Retailers will be notified when inventory is running low and will be given options to order directly from the favourite distributor or available distributors. Goods consumption will be monitored for both retailer and distributor to provide analytics data on which items are being sold frequently, and which ones are not. Furthermore, the platform will have different accounts for different users, users can be distributors, retailers, and clerk for both sides. For example, a distributor account can view all relevant information and make decisions and necessary changes, such as current stock and monthly report on consumption; retailer account can view current stock of the store, along with business analytics information of each of the stock item types, and can make decision on re-order certain items; clerk accounts on both sides will have less privileges than the owners. By default the clerks can only view non-crucial information such as current stock, but their privileges can be customized by corresponding retailers.</p>
